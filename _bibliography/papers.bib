  title={The meaning of relativity},
  author={Einstein, Albert and Taub, AH},
  abstract={In 1921, five years after the appearance of his comprehensive paper on general relativity and twelve years before he left Europe permanently to join the Institute for Advanced Study, Albert Einstein visited Princeton University, where he delivered the Stafford Little Lectures for that year. These four lectures constituted an overview of his then-controversial theory of relativity. Princeton University Press made the lectures available under the title The Meaning of Relativity, the first book by Einstein to be produced by an American publisher. As subsequent editions were brought out by the Press, Einstein included new material amplifying the theory. A revised version of the appendix “Relativistic Theory of the Non-Symmetric Field,” added to the posthumous edition of 1956, was Einstein’s last scientific paper.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={The word “clusters” in scientific terminology as aggregated molecules or atoms appeared in chemistry relatively recently. The terms clusters have been used intensively since the discovery of fullerenes. The term cluster is not a new one for other branches of science such as astrophysics-star cluster, globular cluster, galaxy cluster, in biology and medicine-cancer cluster, genetic cluster, or in computing-data cluster. Adducts in chemistry were known significantly earlier.},

  author={Einstein, A.},
  abstract={It will be shown in this paper that, according to the molecular-kinetic theory of heat, bodies of microscopically visible size suspended in liquids must, as a result of thermal molecular motions, perform motions of such magnitude that these motions can easily be detected by a microscope. It is possible that the motions to be discussed here are identical with the so-called "Brownian molecular motion"; however, the data available to me on the latter are so imprecise that I could not form a definite opinion on this .},
